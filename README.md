# Predicting Box Office Revenue Based on Early Rotten Tomatoes Score and Social Media Sentiment

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating a movie's box office revenue within its first week of release. The model leverages early Rotten Tomatoes scores and aggregated social media sentiment as key predictors.  This analysis seeks to improve the accuracy of box office revenue forecasting, enabling studios to make more informed investment decisions.  The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files, including:

* `sales_trend.png`:  A plot visualizing the relationship between predicted and actual box office revenue.  (Add any other generated plot files here)

The specific output may vary depending on the dataset used and model performance.  Consult the included Jupyter Notebook for a more detailed analysis and exploration of the results.
